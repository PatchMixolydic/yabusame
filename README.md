# Yabusame
Never forget anything.

Yabusame is a todo list that can go wherever it wants. It achieves this by
providing a centralized server which can talk to multiple clients. If you're
only looking for a local todo list, Yabusame might not be for you.

## Map
* `yabusame` - the library powering everything
* `yabuserver` - a server which can provide data for `yabu` and `yabusite`
* `yabusite` -  a web client for `yabuserver`
* `yabu` - a terminal client for `yabuserver`
